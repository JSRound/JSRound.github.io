üÉè **Jack of all trades** is my second name.   
I get along very well with databases, apps, servers, frontends, styles, testing, infrastructures, CI/CD, etc...   
Keen on Maths, Statistic & Logic I am also very curious and don't like unsolved problems.  
I lived for 3 exciting years in England & met people from all over the world, from Nepal to Egipt.
